# ![alt text][logo] Zeppelin Element Library

[//]: # 'TODO: change intro text - current one is from carbon components'

The Zeppelin Design System is a series of individual styles and components, that when combined make beautiful, intuitive designs. These designs are systemic and logical, as they all follow the same universal principles.

The element library gives developers a collection of re-usable partials for building their products.
